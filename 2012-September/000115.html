<PRE>[...]

&gt;<i> &gt; I want mkisofs to use only builtin character set definitions. Because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already happened that there was file 'default' created in the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directory where mkisofs is executed from and mkisofs thought that it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; charset definition file. Mkisofs opened the file and exited with error.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to avoid that by ensuring that builtin charset definition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is a missunderstanding at your side. The manpage still talks about 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;builtin&quot; charsets, but charsets that are really builtin into mkliaofs have 
</I>&gt;<i> gone more than 5 years ago when iconv support was added to support more complex 
</I>&gt;<i> charsets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the charset name &quot;default&quot; (which is the only left builtin 
</I>&gt;<i> charset) needs to get precedence before file name based translations.
</I>
Ah, that explains. I thought &quot;buitlin&quot; = /usr/lib/siconv/*



&gt;<i> &gt; According to man page it should be possible to force builtin charset
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definition usage by ensuring that -input-charset argument is one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; builtins. Since mkisofs behaves differently than described in man, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suppose it's a bug.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, it may be a good idea to first search the default translation table 
</I>&gt;<i> location before looking in the current directory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ....or to look at non-default-path files only in case the charset name contains 
</I>&gt;<i> a slash to denote a path name. This would mean that a name in the current 
</I>&gt;<i> directory would have to be named &quot;./coding&quot;.
</I>
Both sounds fine to me. It ensures that '-input-charset 8859-1' won't
read anything else than /usr/lib/siconv/8859-1. I guess it depends on
whether you want to allow to override the /usr/lib/siconv/* tables or
not. Even if there is a bug in /usr/lib/siconv/8859-1 (for example), one
may fix it creating local table of a different name (fix_8859-1) and use
that.

My case would best suit the order:

a) try INS_BASE/lib/siconv/*
b) try dynamic path based on getexecname
c) try openning plain file

Of course that's just me.


[...]

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why do you use an outdated version?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We would like to use stable version. Latest is in the directory 'alpha',
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which suggests that it may not be as stable as the release 3.00. And I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already tried latest (cdrtools-3.01a08) which does not solve the issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> stable means dead.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is why there is a longer testing period before something is declared 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;stable&quot;.
</I>
Heh, I would rather see 'dead but working' than 'alive and potentialy
broken', if possible :) But fun aside, I'll take it as recommendation to
upgrade to latest 3.01a08.



&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Since 2010, libsiconv uses a dynamic method to find it's installation base.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can see that the function pfopen is now more complex. So if I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; calling mkisofs from a wrapper, it's even more difficult to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only builtin character encoding is used.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe so...
</I>
If you will be willing to accept either of those solutions discussed
above, it's irrelevant.


Thank you
