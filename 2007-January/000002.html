I did that, here's the answer I obtained from Fedora Core project:

the problem is:
1. Pioneer needs some special SG_IO commands, which are only allowed as
root
2. cdrecord/cdrtools has changed its license and should be dropped
anyway, as
soon as there is an alternative.

This post only to inform you about what is happening around cdrecord in
Fedora Core.

Anyway I tested the above mentioned alpha code... it seems that now
cdrecord recognize DVD+R media and that is using the dvdplusr driver
during the burning process. Anyway the result is similar to that
obtained with the old code... the media is unreadable (no problems
during the burning process). Now I decided to buy some DVD-R instead of
DVD+R which is better supported by Pioneer. If you need more information
please contact me on this list.

Bye, Andrea.
