<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to follow up with this old thread to finish what we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started. The problem was that there was not a way how to specify which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; siconv table should be used. Specifying just it's name first looks into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current directory whether there is such file, which can lead to various
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; side effects.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your proposal was:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; My proposal was:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 1) try to open as filename in case the parameter is a string contraining a '/'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 2) try to open path based on getexecname
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 3) try to open via INS_BASE/lib/siconv/* 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How would you feel about the attached patch?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks OK, sorry for the delay.
</I>
Thank you, my delay was &quot;slightly&quot; longer.


&gt;<i> BTW: a month ago, I received a mail from a friend that claims that Oracle 
</I>&gt;<i> Solaris-11.1 is shipped with a very old version of cdrtools (2.01 from 2004).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Could you comment this please?
</I>
Solaris 10 - cdrtools 2.01
Solaris 11 - cdrtools 3.00

Solaris 10 is in sustaining mode only, only if customer reports an issue
or there's security problem we do something about it. And even then
usually just the smallest change, so probably just patch fixing the one
issue.

Solaris 10 is 9 years old if I count right.

Now on bare 11.1 (without any additional changes released later):

&gt;<i> $ pkg list entire
</I>&gt;<i> NAME (PUBLISHER)                                  VERSION                    IFO
</I>&gt;<i> entire                                            0.5.11-0.175.1.0.0.24.2    i--
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $ cat /etc/release 
</I>&gt;<i>                              Oracle Solaris 11.1 X86
</I>&gt;<i>   Copyright (c) 1983, 2012, Oracle and/or its affiliates.  All rights reserved.
</I>&gt;<i>                            Assembled 19 September 2012
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $ /usr/bin/cdrecord -version
</I>&gt;<i> Cdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone 3.00 (i386-pc-solaris2.11) Copyright (C) 1995-2010 J&#65533;rg Schilling
</I>
I just noticed that your name is not displayed correctly (umlaut o), but
that seems to be because I'm using utf-8 output (I am normally able to
read and write &#246;)

In 11 and current development version we are using 3.00 which is still
old. I know we discussed it back then and I was surprised that you are
suggesting your alpha releases. I brought that to our attention this
morning internally that we should update to latest. The thing is that we
have bunch of custom patches[1] which make possible to make Solaris
bootable.

I tried to check how hard would be to merge the patches with your latest
release, but I haven't found any repository, only releases on ftp. I
want to import the releases locally into mercurial and see how well the
patches will be applicable. I haven't seen the patches before, so I
can't comment on them more at the moment, but it would be great if you
would have the time to look at them. Just to have rough idea of how you
like/dislike what they are doing, what are the chances of merging the
work with upstream.

Also, even though I can speak German a tiny bit (I have been working in
M&#252;nchen for some time), I am a bit lost in the Changelog :)
